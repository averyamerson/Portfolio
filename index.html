      <h2>About</h2>
      <p class="w3-text-black">Avery Amerson is a constant learner with a desire to continually improve himself and satisfy his intellectual curiosity. His
      education did not end with his master's program, but rather persists as he both dives deeper into topics he is familiar with as 
      well as explores fields with which he has had no prior formal experience. Avery is a recent graduate of California State University, 
      Long Beach, where he earned an M.A. in Philosophy. He earned a B.A. from Illinois Wesleyan University in Psychology, with a minor 
      in Philosophy. Although his formal education was in the humanities and social sciences, his interests extend to many more fields. 
      He is always searching for new and intersting topics to learn about and apply to his life and career pursuits.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-black">His current interests include learning German and studying computer science topics such as cybersecurity, IT troubleshooting 
      for Windows, Linux command line interface, and understanding data science with Python. In the past, he has independently studied 
      other technology topics such as SQL and web creation and design with HTML.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-black">Avery finds something interesting in every field, and as a result, has many hobbies and interests. He has had a lifelong passion
      for martial arts, and holds a black belt in Japanese JuJitsu. He also enjoys drawing and painting, playing guitar, reading, and 
      playing video games.</p>
