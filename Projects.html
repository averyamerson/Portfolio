    <p><b>"Extended Cognition and the Evolution of Human Language"</b>
      <br><i>Master's thesis published in June 2020 by California State University, Long Beach</i> 
      <br>Abstract: The interaction between cognition and the environment may have shaped how human language developed over time. I 
      consider the possibility that extended cognition contributed to the evolution of human language. While ‘internal cognition’ refers 
      to intelligent processes occurring solely in the mind, ‘extended cognition’ refers to the coupling of internal cognition with 
      external objects in the environment. I present a timeline describing major linguistic developments which extended cognition may 
      have impacted: (1) internal cognition and early forms of communication, (2) evolution of protolanguage, (3) co-evolution of full 
      human language and extended cognition, and (4) development of written language. I argue that language and extended cognition are 
      both forms of external scaffolding, which are systems that reduce the burden placed on an organism when interacting with the
      environment. Moreover, I argue that certain language usages ought to be thought of as extended cognitive processes. I discuss and 
      ultimately reject the notion that the presence of extended cognition contributed to the development of protolanguage. I argue that 
      extended cognition arose after the development of protolanguage and co-evolved with full language. Finally, I argue that writing 
      systems are a clear example of how certain uses of language can be considered extended cognitive processes.</p>
    
    <p><b>"Wittgenstein, Extended Cognition, and the Problem of Other Minds"</b>
      <br><i>Research paper presented at California State University, Long Beach's Student Research Competition in December 2018 and at 
      the California State-wide Research Competition in February 2019. Awarded First Place in the Humanities category at both 
      competitions.</i> 
      <br>Abstract: Wittgenstein’s highly influential works have been critiqued and expanded upon by countless philosophers. Although he 
      was never cited as an influence in the seminal paper on the theory of extended cognition by Clark and Chalmers (1998), I argue that 
      this theory, alongside Wittgenstein’s view of public language, can be used to address Wittgenstein’s problem of other minds. This 
      problem is defined by the inability to verify that others have mental states just as we do. If we all share in others' experiences 
      through the connection of public language, then we can know that others experience mental states just as we do, because we are all 
      taking part in the same shared cognitive process. Wittgenstein’s views on the meaning of language and the rejection of private 
      language, taken together with the theory of extended cognition, provide a compelling solution to the problem of other minds.</p>
